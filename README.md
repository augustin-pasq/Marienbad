# Marienbad
Marienbad game numerisation

## Context
This game is a school project realized during the first year of my CS studies.

## Rules
Originally, in the Marienbad game, there are 4 rows of matches. Two players come face to face, each in turn, they can take as many matches as they want of the same row. The one who takes the last matches wins.
This game was numerised and is playable through the terminal.

## How to play?

*Pro tip: the one who starts has more chances to win* 

### Human vs. Human version
File : Marienbad.java

The two players type their names. The first to type his name plays first. The player choose a row and the amount of matches to take.

### Human vs. Machine
File : MarienbadMachine.java

The player chooses his name, and decide if him or the machine starts. Then, when it's the player's turn, he chooses the row and the amount of matches to take
*Pro tip 2: if the machine starts, the player will lose (do not try to contradict me :))*

## How to launch a game?

Some notions in programming where not broached when this project was made. To run the .java files, `Start.class` and `SimpleInput.class` in the `/class` folder are needed.
Run the files with the command `java Start Marienbad.java`
